# Step 6: Produce a structured report

> **Time:** 10 minutes

## What you'll produce

You'll produce a concise report that separates page evidence, criterion mapping, remediation, and
the limits of the review.

## Separate evidence from interpretation

An agent response contains **evidence** and **interpretation**. Evidence is what Playwright
observed, such as an input with no accessible name. Interpretation is the criterion mapping and
remediation based on that evidence and the catalog result.

A clear output contract tells the agent what to include, what to leave out, and how to handle
uncertainty. It makes reports more consistent without claiming that the review is exhaustive.

## Be useful without overstating the result

One automated snapshot cannot establish accessibility conformance. The report should stick to
high-confidence findings without invented statistics, decorative severity labels, or a broad claim
that the page passes or fails WCAG.

The agent now turns `browser evidence + catalog result` into a bounded, repeatable report.

## Give the report a contract

:::language dotnet
### 1. Add the report contract

Create `workshop-app/Helpers/Prompts.cs`:

```csharp
namespace HelloCopilotSDK.Helpers;

public static class Prompts
{
    public static string CreateReportPrompt(Uri targetUri) => $"""
        Prepare an evidence-based accessibility review of {targetUri.AbsoluteUri}.

        1. Use browser_navigate to open that exact URL.
        2. Call read_latest_accessibility_snapshot to inspect its accessibility tree.
        3. Identify three to five high-confidence issues supported by the snapshot.
        4. Call accessibility_rule_lookup for each issue before recommending a fix.

        Return only this structure:

        # Accessibility review
        ## Finding 1: <short name>
        - Evidence: <specific element or page structure observed in the browser>
        - WCAG criterion: <criterion and title returned by the catalog>
        - Recommended remediation: <specific implementation change>

        Repeat the finding section as needed.

        ## Review limits
        State that this is a focused review of browser-observable evidence, not a full WCAG conformance audit.

        Do not invent evidence, report unsupported statistics, or claim the page is WCAG compliant.
        """;
}
```
:::
:::language dotnet
### 2. Use the contract

Replace the final send call in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nAnalyzing: {targetUri.AbsoluteUri}\n");
await ResponseStreamer.SendAndPrintAsync(session, Prompts.CreateReportPrompt(targetUri));
```
:::
## Run it

:::language dotnet
```bash
dotnet run --project workshop-app
```
:::
When the app asks for a URL, paste:

```text
{{TARGET_APP_URL}}
```

The report should follow this shape:

```text
# Accessibility review
## Finding 1: Input has no accessible name
- Evidence: The snapshot contains a textbox with no accessible name.
- WCAG criterion: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value
- Recommended remediation: Associate a visible label using matching for and id values.

## Review limits
This focused review uses browser-observable evidence and is not a full WCAG conformance audit.
```

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting this run</summary>

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| The output contains unsupported counts | Confirm the prompt says not to report unsupported statistics. |
| A finding has no concrete element or structure | Treat it as ungrounded; keep the evidence requirement in the report contract. |
| The response claims WCAG compliance | Keep the required **Review limits** section and explicit prohibition. |

</details>

> **You're ready for the final run when:** each finding contains specific browser evidence, a
> catalog criterion, and a remediation, and the report ends with its limits.

## Check your understanding

In the report, which content is direct evidence and which content is model interpretation?

<details>
<summary>Check your answer</summary>

The element or page structure returned by Playwright is evidence. Choosing the criterion and
writing the remediation are interpretations based on that evidence and the catalog result.

Continue to [Step 7: Run and explain the application](07-run-explain.md).

:::language nodejs
Use `reportPrompt(target)` from `src/workshop.ts`; it requires three to five evidence-backed
findings and the same review limits as the .NET version.
:::
:::language python
Run `python main.py "{{TARGET_APP_URL}}"`. It calls `report_prompt(target)` from `workshop.py`,
which requires three to five evidence-backed findings and the same review limits as the .NET version.
:::
:::language go
Use `reportPrompt(target)` in `main.go` and run `go run . "{{TARGET_APP_URL}}"`. It requires three to five evidence-backed findings, catalog mapping, remediation, and the review-limit statement. If output claims compliance, preserve the explicit limits in the prompt. See [`checkpoints/go/06-structured-report`](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/copilot-sdk-workshop/tree/main/checkpoints/go/06-structured-report).
:::
:::language rust
Use `report_prompt(&target)` in `src/main.rs` and run `cargo run -- "{{TARGET_APP_URL}}"`. The expected report contains evidence, criterion, remediation, and no unsupported statistics. If a finding lacks snapshot evidence, exclude it. See [`checkpoints/rust/06-structured-report`](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/copilot-sdk-workshop/tree/main/checkpoints/rust/06-structured-report).
:::
:::language java
Use `reportPrompt(target)` in `AccessibilityReport.java` and run `mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="{{TARGET_APP_URL}}"`. The result has three to five bounded findings plus Review limits. If Maven cannot execute the main class, use the checkpoint POM's configured exec plugin. See [`checkpoints/java/06-structured-report`](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/copilot-sdk-workshop/tree/main/checkpoints/java/06-structured-report).
