# Step 5: Combine local and MCP tools

> **Time:** 15 minutes

## What you'll orchestrate

After this step, a learner-supplied URL will drive one agent turn that gathers browser evidence
with Playwright and retrieves remediation guidance from the local WCAG catalog.

## Let the agent choose the right tool

**Agent orchestration** is the model choosing and sequencing available capabilities to accomplish
a goal. Your session exposes two very different tools through one interface:

- Playwright discovers facts about the live page.
- The C# catalog explains a matching criterion and remediation.

Both tools emit the same `ToolExecutionStartEvent` and `ToolExecutionCompleteEvent`. That common
event model lets your application observe orchestration without knowing how each tool is
implemented.

## Keep evidence and guidance in their lanes

One tool should not pretend to do another tool's job. Browser evidence must come from the browser;
authoritative application guidance must come from the application. Combining them produces a more
grounded answer than asking the model to infer both.

> **Where it fits:** `URL -> Playwright evidence -> WCAG catalog lookup -> grounded response`.

## Put both tools to work

### 1. Read and validate a URL

Remove the command-line argument validation from Step 4. After the banner and before creating the
client, insert:

```csharp
Console.Write("Enter URL to analyze: ");
var urlInput = Console.ReadLine()?.Trim();

if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(urlInput))
{
    Console.Error.WriteLine("Enter a URL to analyze.");
    return;
}

if (!urlInput.Contains("://", StringComparison.Ordinal))
{
    urlInput = $"https://{urlInput}";
}

if (!Uri.TryCreate(urlInput, UriKind.Absolute, out var targetUri) ||
    targetUri.Scheme is not ("http" or "https"))
{
    Console.Error.WriteLine("Enter an absolute HTTP or HTTPS URL.");
    return;
}
```

The handler from Step 4 receives this validated `targetUri`, so its URL boundary still applies.

### 2. Give the agent a three-tool goal

Replace the final prompt:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"\nAnalyzing: {targetUri.AbsoluteUri}\n");
await ResponseStreamer.SendAndPrintAsync(
    session,
    $"""
    Use browser_navigate to open {targetUri.AbsoluteUri}, then call read_latest_accessibility_snapshot.
    Identify two high-confidence accessibility issues supported by the snapshot.
    For each issue, call accessibility_rule_lookup and return:
    - the browser evidence;
    - the matching criterion;
    - the catalog's recommended remediation.
    """);
```

The prompt assigns evidence gathering and guidance to their correct sources. It does not prescribe
the exact order of every catalog lookup; the agent can orchestrate those calls.

## Run it

```bash
dotnet run --project workshop-app
```

Paste this URL when prompted:

```text
{{TARGET_APP_URL}}
```

You should see both capability families:

```text
[tool:start] playwright-browser_navigate
[tool:start] read_latest_accessibility_snapshot
[tool:start] accessibility_rule_lookup

- Evidence: The text input has no accessible name ...
- WCAG criterion: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value
- Recommended remediation: Associate a visible <label> ...
```

The exact order and wording can vary. The evidence must come from Playwright, and the criterion
must match the catalog.

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting this run</summary>

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Only Playwright tools run | Keep the explicit instruction to call `accessibility_rule_lookup` for each issue. |
| The catalog tool runs before browser inspection | This can be valid planning, but reject any final finding that lacks browser evidence. |
| The URL is rejected | Enter an HTTP or HTTPS URL; a missing scheme is automatically changed to `https://`. |

</details>

> **You are ready to continue when:** one run names both a Playwright tool and
> `accessibility_rule_lookup`, then connects observed evidence to catalog guidance.

## Check your understanding

Which tool should discover an input without an accessible name, and which tool should explain the
associated WCAG criterion?

<details>
<summary>Check your answer</summary>

Playwright discovers the input from the live page. The local catalog returns the application's
authoritative criterion and remediation.
